# BattleshipS19

A twist on the classic boardgame Battleship, written entirely in Java for an introductory-level computer science course.

Some of its features:

* A basic AI that selects targets based on randomization

* New weapon types (e.g. scatter shot, a scout that can peek a small section of the enemy's board, etc)

Note that this is a *proof-of-concept prototype*: we have an output and a basic playable game, but many functions and bugs need to be ironed out. This project was an exercise in designing the foundations for a modular game that can easily implement new features.

`latestProto4` contains the final prototype of this game.
