README

A plaintext README file (â€œREADME.txt") with a detailed description of how to compile, run, and use your program:

(1) To use this program--compile all files with javac *.java. Then, run java Main.

(2) Main class is contained in Main.java, which upon running will create a JPanel with two grids representing the two players' battleship fields. 

(3) HOW TO USE: This is a simple point-and-click prototype that represents the visual interface that will respond to clicks to fill in the spaces on the grids. For now, the user can simply hover their mouse over the desired square that they wish to fill and click with their mouse to "place" ships visually, upon which the program will fill in the corresponding square (with color being red or green depending on whether the user has selected the left or right grid).
